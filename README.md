## Inspiration

As college students with roommates, sometimes we just need privacy.

Maybe you need time to take a nap while your roommate's being noisy. Maybe you need to enjoy some relaxation, either alone or with another. Maybe you're traveling, and you want somewhere to nap and do work without having to deal with other people.

The problem is, it's impossible to rent out a hotel or an AirBNB for just a few hours. It's just too expensive!

## What it does

This application matches those seeking the privacy of a room with those who have rooms to spare.

Rentees can rent rooms for a few hours at a time, taking advantage of the bed to sleep, work in privacy, or take care of other needs.

Likewise, renters can rent out empty rooms without the burden of having to accommodate someone overnight, and earn extra money while they're at it.

## How we built it

For two of us, this was our first experience in working with ASP .NET core and Microsoft Azure. 

The backend is hosted on Azure, and the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the maps and places functionality provided by the Google Cloud Platform.

## Challenges we ran into

This was our first attempt at building a comprehensive full-stack web and mobile application, and was a very intimidating process. Lots of debugging and documentation reading was necessary to finish the application.

We also worked on front end and back end separately, making integration a fun challenge.

## What's next

Hopefully, we can integrate secure payments and chat systems between renters and rentees to flesh out the functionality of this application. Moreover, a more comprehensive review system would promote mutual responsibility between all parties, and AI and Machine Learning could facilitate better room recommendations
