# Tap N Nap

Yes it's real.

Finish in a minute!

## Inspiration

All of us live with roommates, and we all wished that we had some time to ourselves. 

## What it does

Matches people looking for a room to nap in with people who have a room with a bed.

## How we built it

Lots of crying and learning about ASP .NET Core.

## Challenges we ran into

None of us had done a proper full stack application before, which was quite intimidating.

## What's next

Integrate payment and chat systems along with a more comprehensive reviewing system. Potentially also adding AI and Machine Learning to help facilitate recommendations.

## Built with

Google Maps, ASP .NET Core, C#, Bootstrap.
